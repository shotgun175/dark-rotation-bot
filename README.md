# Dark Rotation Manager

Tracks and announces the Lost Ark dark grenade rotation with an always-on-top
overlay and configurable hotkeys. Confirms throws manually via hotkey.

---

## Features

- Always-on-top overlay shows current player, next player, and countdown bar
- Two-phase timing: player window → dark buff countdown (20 s normal / 25 s splendid)
- Auto-skips players whose grenade is still on cooldown
- Tracks per-player throw count; stops the rotation when everyone hits the cap
- Configurable hotkeys (works while Lost Ark is in focus)
- PyQt5 GUI for editing roster, rotation settings, hotkeys, and overlay — live while the bot is running
- Overlay position saves automatically when dragged; restores on next launch
- GUI window position also saves and restores on next launch
- Optional OpenCV auto-detection: scans boss debuff bar for Dark / Splendid Dark Grenade icon and auto-confirms with correct timer (20s / 25s)
- Detection region configurable via manual spinboxes or drag-to-draw tool in the Overlay tab
- **Pause / Resume (F8):** freeze the rotation mid-fight; on resume, scans for an active dark and either restarts the buff countdown or advances to the next player
- **Reset (F11):** clears all throw counts and returns to player 1 in an armed-but-not-started state, without closing the overlay
- TTS audio cues for all key events including reset confirmation
- `Dark Rotation Manager.exe` ships with the Splendid Dark Grenade as its icon

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11
- Python 3.11+ — https://www.python.org/downloads/

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Dark-Rotation-Manager.git
cd Dark-Rotation-Manager
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the GUI

```bash
python gui.py
```

Edit your roster, hotkeys, and settings from the GUI. Click **Apply** to save,
then **▶ Launch** to arm the bot (overlay appears, audio pre-renders), then press **F8** to start the rotation.

---

## Hotkeys (defaults)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| F8  | Start → Pause → Resume rotation |
| F9  | Confirm dark thrown (starts 20–25 s buff countdown) |
| F10 | Dark missed (counts toward throw limit, advances to next player) |
| F11 | Reset rotation to player 1 (armed but not started) |

Rebind any key in the GUI under the **Hotkeys** tab, or directly in `config.yaml`.

## How it works

1. Click **▶ Launch** — the GUI hides, the overlay appears, and audio clips are pre-rendered in the background
2. Press **F8** when you're ready — the rotation starts and the first player is announced
3. **Phase 1 — Player window (20 s):**
   - Press **F9** when the player throws their dark grenade
   - If no confirm within 20 s, the bot fires a miss event automatically
4. **Phase 2 — Dark buff countdown:**
   - After a confirm, the buff timer runs (20 s normal / 25 s splendid)
   - A warning fires near the end, naming the next player
   - When the buff expires, the next player's window begins
5. Press **F10** if a player misses — counts the miss and advances to next player
6. Players on cooldown are skipped automatically
7. Once every player hits `max_throws_per_run`, the rotation ends
8. **Pause / Resume — F8 (while running):** freezes the overlay and stops the timer. On resume, the bot scans for an active dark grenade — if found, restarts the buff countdown; if not, advances to the next player
9. **Reset — F11:** clears all throw counts, returns to player 1, and returns to the armed state. Press **F8** to start again. The overlay stays visible; a TTS cue confirms the reset
10. **Stop — overlay ■ button:** tears down the bot entirely and restores the GUI

## Config reference

```yaml
rotation:
  warning_seconds: 5            # warning callout N seconds before next window
  dark_cooldown_seconds: 30     # skip players whose grenade is still on cooldown
  max_throws_per_run: 3         # per-player throw cap; rotation ends when all reach it
  active_roster: my_raid.yaml

hotkeys:
  start_stop: f8
  confirm: f9
  missed: f10
  reset: f11

overlay:
  position: {x: 0, y: 0}       # auto-saved when you drag the overlay
  width: 320
  height: 230
  opacity: 0.88
  font_size: 16

gui:
  position: {x: 100, y: 100}   # auto-saved when you move the GUI window
```

## Building a standalone .exe

To create a double-clickable executable (no terminal, no Python required):

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --icon=assets/icon.ico --name="Dark Rotation Manager" --clean --hidden-import=edge_tts --hidden-import=aiohttp gui.py
```

Output: `dist/Dark Rotation Manager.exe` — run it directly from the `dist/` folder. Re-run this command any time you update the code.
`config.yaml`, `rosters/`, and `assets/` are read from the project root automatically.

---

## Multiple Rosters

Create additional `.yaml` files in the `rosters/` folder using the same format.
Change `active_roster` in `config.yaml` (or via the GUI) to switch between them.

## Changelog

### v1.0.14 - Pause, reset, and path fixes
- **F8 pause / resume:** pressing F8 while running now pauses the rotation (overlay shows ⏸ PAUSED, bar freezes). Press F8 again to resume — the bot scans for an active dark grenade and either restarts the buff countdown or advances to the next player
- **F11 reset:** clears all throw counts and returns to player 1 in the armed-but-not-started state without closing the overlay. TTS announces "Dark rotation reset" as confirmation
- **Overlay stop button** is now the only way to fully shut down and restore the GUI
- **Audio:** new "Dark rotation reset" TTS cue (toggleable in Audio tab)
- **Path fix:** exe running from `dist/` now correctly resolves `config.yaml`, `rosters/`, and `assets/` from the project root

### v1.0.13 - Rename to Dark Rotation Manager
- Project renamed from **Dark Rotation Bot** to **Dark Rotation Manager**
- Exe and window title updated to match

### v1.0.12 - Audio cue system, GUI hide on launch, overlay stop button
- **Audio cue system:** TTS voice callouts via Microsoft Edge neural voices (Andrew / Jenny selectable in Audio tab). Announces the current player's name, warns the next player, confirms throws, and plays an optional chime on auto-detection
- **Audio tab:** New GUI tab with master enable toggle, per-cue checkboxes (announce, warning, confirmed, rotation complete, chime), voice selector, volume slider, and Test Voice button. All options gray out visually when audio is disabled
- **Phase 1 warning:** `[Player], get ready` now fires 5 seconds before a player's window closes - even if no dark was confirmed - so the next player always gets a heads-up
- **Launch / F8 split:** Clicking **Launch** arms the bot (overlay shows, audio pre-renders) but does not start the timer. Press **F8** when ready - audio clips are guaranteed loaded by then, so the first announce always plays
- **GUI hides on Launch:** Config window disappears when the bot is armed, freeing screen space and preventing accidental roster resets. A stop button in the top-right of the overlay tears down the bot and restores the GUI
- **Tab reorder:** Audio tab moved before Overlay tab
- **Removed:** Dark missed TTS cue (F10 advances the rotation silently)
- **Cleanup:** Removed legacy `main.py` headless entry point; removed unused `mutagen` dependency

### v1.0.11 - Throw counts, spam fix, taskbar icon
- **Throw counts on overlay:** player names now show their throw count inline (e.g. `Valslayer 1/3`, `Mabi 0/3`)
- **Spam protection:** duplicate confirms are ignored while the dark buff is active - throw count can no longer exceed the cap
- **Window icon:** title bar and taskbar now show the grenade icon at runtime
- **Taskbar fix:** app registers its own Windows App User Model ID so it gets a dedicated taskbar button instead of grouping under Python

### v1.0.1 - UI overhaul, detection improvements, buff display fix
- **Overlay tab redesign:** single scrollable left column replaces the fixed right panel - controls never clip or stretch as the window is resized
- **Appearance preview moved inline:** sits next to the Position/Size spinboxes; Region preview sits next to the detection region controls
- **Window resize cap:** maximum window size capped at 1050x680 to prevent excessive stretching
- **Text contrast pass:** all gray text lifted across every tab
- **Font size pass:** UI-wide bump (9->11px, 11->13px, 13->14px); spinboxes now render at 14px
- **Auto-detection card:** checkbox is wrapped in a styled card with a gold indicator when enabled - much easier to notice and toggle
- **Buff display fix:** DARK NOW stays on the thrower for the full 20/25s buff countdown; switches to next player only when buff expires
- **Auto-detection:** Optional OpenCV-based grenade detection scans the boss debuff bar automatically - detects Dark (20s) and Splendid Dark (25s) automatically
- **Visual region selector:** drag-to-draw tool covering all monitors, relative to Lost Ark window
- **Renamed executable:** `gui.exe` -> `Dark Timer.exe`

### Initial release
- PyQt5 tabbed config GUI (Roster, Rotation, Hotkeys, Overlay)
- Always-on-top overlay HUD with countdown bar
- Live Apply: push config changes to running bot without restart
- Overlay and GUI window positions auto-save on drag/move
- Hotkey rebinding via click-to-capture UI
- Standalone `Dark Timer.exe` build
